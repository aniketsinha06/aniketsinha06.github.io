									<h3>About Virtual Assistant</h3>
									<p> Virtual Voice Assistant is a program that performs duties or services for an individual based on voice commands or questions. 
										Virtual assistant is an advanced equipment for everyone in this new era of 21st century. It has presented a new technology where 
										we can ask questions and can interact with machines as we do with other people. This virtual assistant is developed by using <b>Speech Recognition</b> technology
										combined with <b>Machine Learning</b> and <strong>Computer Vision</strong> to perform different services on voice commands.	
									</p>
									
									<h3>Speech Recognition</h3>
									<p> Speech recognition is a field of computer science that develops technologies that can recognize spoken words and phrases and convert them into text by computers. 
										The program can be used to implement virtual assistants.</p>

									<h3>Implementation</h3>
									<dd>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/neural_network.jpg" alt="" /></span>Each module has been implemented
											separately and their trained models are saved. These models are used in the development of virtual assistant which 
											executes these models at different time depending on requirements. Face Recognition model is utilized to detect user,
											image classification with neural network is used to identify any image, deep neural network to reconize traffic sign 
											is used to predict traffic sign in images and videos etc.</p>

										<h3>1. User Identification - LOGIN</h3>
								
										<p>As soon as program starts, Virtual Assistant will verify if the user is authorized to use the services or not. 
											Program will perform <b>Face Recognition</b> - Computer Vision algorithm via webcam to identify the user. Face Recognition 
											full project is available in <a class = "scrollBold" href="https://github.com/aniketsinha06/Face-Recognition-Computer-Vision/blob/master/Face%20Recognition%20Using%20PCA.ipynb">Github</a>.
